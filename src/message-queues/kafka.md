## ðŸ“Š Kafka Deep-Dive (Architecture, Concepts, Interview Points)

### Core Idea

Kafka is a **distributed, append-only log system** designed for high-throughput, durable, fault-tolerant event streaming.

- Messages go to a **topic**
- Each topic is split into **partitions**
- Each partition is an immutable ordered log
- Consumers track progress via **offsets**

### Key Concepts

| Term                 | Explanation                                                             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broker               | Kafka server node                                                       |
| Topic                | Named stream of records                                                 |
| Partition            | Ordered log shard for scaling (unit of parallelism)                     |
| Leader / ISR         | One broker is leader; others are *In-Sync Replicas*                     |
| Consumer Group       | Multiple consumers reading same topic; each partition assigned uniquely |
| Offset               | Position within a partition log                                         |
| Idempotent Producer  | Guarantees no duplicate messages on retry                               |
| Transactional Writer | Enables exactly-once semantics across MK writes                         |

### Delivery Semantics

| Mode          | Description                         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| At-Most-Once  | Never retry â†’ may lose on error     |
| At-Least-Once | Retry â†’ duplicates possible         |
| Exactly-Once  | Requires idempotent + transactional |

### Strengths & Use-cases

- High throughput event streaming
- Replayable log (state re-creation, CDC pipelines)
- Decoupled microservices
- Log aggregation / real-time analytics

### Common Interview Questions

**Q: Compare Kafka with RabbitMQ.**  
A: Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform designed for high-throughput and persistent log storage. It excels at event replay, analytics, and decoupled microservice communication. RabbitMQ is a traditional message broker using queues and smart routing (exchanges); itâ€™s optimized for task distribution, RPC, and low-latency message delivery. Kafka is pull-based with log retention; RabbitMQ is push-based with delete-on-consume behavior.

---

**Q: What is ISR and how does replica lag work?**  
A: ISR (In-Sync Replicas) are brokers that have fully replicated the leader partition up to the most recent offset within a configured lag threshold. A replica falls out of ISR if it lags beyond that threshold (due to failure or slow processing). Only ISR replicas are eligible for leader election during failover to ensure no data loss.

---

**Q: How does Kafka support horizontal scaling?**  
A: Kafka scales by splitting topics into multiple partitions. Each partition can be placed on different brokers and consumed independently. Producers can send messages to specific partitions using key-based partitioning, and consumer groups can add more consumers to process partitions in parallel. More partitions = more read/write concurrency.

---

**Q: What is the difference between an idempotent producer and a transactional producer?**  
A: Idempotent producers ensure that even if retries occur, messages are not duplicated; they do this by attaching a sequence number so the broker can ignore duplicates. Transactional producers go further by allowing **multiple writes across topics and partitions to be committed atomically**, enabling exactly-once processing semantics across producers â†’ and even consumers â†’ when used with Kafka Streams.

---

**Q: What is a consumer group? What happens when you add a new member?**  
A: A consumer group is a set of consumers cooperatively reading from a topic; Kafka ensures that each partition is read by exactly one consumer in the group. When a new consumer joins the group, Kafka triggers a **rebalance**: partition assignments are recalculated and redistributed among all members. During rebalance, consumption pauses briefly while consumers receive new assignments.
